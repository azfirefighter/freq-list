Radio/Scanner Frequency List
============================

This repository contains lists of channels and frequencies which you
can monitor or, if properly licensed and using the appropaite
equipment, transmit on.

The lists are organized heirarchically. Each list is formatted using a
modified version of [RFC6690](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6690), which
allows for hash-style comments.

The actual frequencies are formatted using the freq-URI, as described
here: <http://www.deepdarc.com/2011/09/30/x-freq-uri/>.

----

I make no claims to the accuracy of the information contained in this
collection. Use at your own risk. Do not transmit on any frequency
that you are not licensed to transmit on. If you would like to transmit
on the amateur frequencies, become a ham. It's fun and easy!
